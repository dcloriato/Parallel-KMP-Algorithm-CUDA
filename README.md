This is a parallel version of the KMP string matching algorithm.

It takes the string in the pattern.txt file (remember to keep the - ) and finds the number of matches in the text_string.txt file. Program outputs to the command line.

Included is the serial version of the algorithm to show the difference in run times, which are output into the command line.

Currently doesn't support multiple lines in the text_string.txt file, it must be one continuous string.
